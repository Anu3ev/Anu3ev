## Alexander Anufriev | Frontend Engineer (Vue, TypeScript)

I build high-performance, product-oriented interfaces with Vue 2/3, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
For the last 4+ years I’ve been working on an e-commerce SaaS platform, designing and shipping features used by 60k+ merchants.

I enjoy turning unclear requirements into clear UI, scalable architecture, and a smooth user experience.
I’m comfortable owning features end to end, from concept and API contracts to release and iteration.

### Focus areas
- Vue 2/3, TypeScript, JavaScript, Nuxt
- UI architecture, performance, maintainability
- Complex interactive tools (Canvas, editors), integrations, admin panels
- Vite / Webpack, Git, CI basics
